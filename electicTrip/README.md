An electric car's endurance is given by the amount of energy it can store in its battery (KWh)
and its efficiency (how many Km you can drive with one KWh of energy). Since electric
chargers are not yet so frequent on the road it is important to plan a trip according to where
the you can getCurrentCharge.
The very first charging stations are found today on highways near cities.
A trip is defined by a set of cities separated by the number of Km between two cities.
It is useful to have system that tells you to stop when you are passing by a charger if there's
no further charging infrastructure within the given range. This test suite will bring you to
build such a system.
